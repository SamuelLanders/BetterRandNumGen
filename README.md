# BetterRandNumGen

🛠️ Installation

Download the BetterRandNumGen addon for Godot 4.x. Extract the betterrandnumgen folder into the addons folder within your Godot project directory. Enable the addon in Godot's plugins tab. (Project > Project Settings > Plugins)

📖 Usage

Can use as either main screen plugin (click interface) or as direct plugin to your application (call to class_name BetterRandNumGen )
Functions:

   BetterRandNumGen.randi()
   
   BetterRandNumGen.randi_range()
   
   BetterRandNumGen.randf()
   
   BetterRandNumGen.randf_range()
   
   BetterRandNumGen.generate_digits( v_need:int )
   
   BetterRandNumGen.get_from_array(x=0,y=0,arrToUse=0)	not intended for external use. Internally used to collect a random digit

The 'Main screen plugin' aspect has very limited functionality, and will appear next to the 2D,3D,Script,AssetLib buttons in the top center of Godot 4.x
