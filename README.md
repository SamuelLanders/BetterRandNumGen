# BetterRandNumGen
It's a better random number generator, ie. all digits that come out of it follow a normal distribution. Additionally this generator does not require preparation to work properly, ie. you do not call randomize() at any point. Finally it adds the ability to generate streams of random numeric digits of any length, output as a string.
