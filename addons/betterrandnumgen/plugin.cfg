description="The main goal of this plugin is to create a better random number generator, ie. all digits that come out of it follow a normal distribution. This is because during testing I noted some issues with the Godot PCG random number generator. Further testing found that all the different Windows and Linux random number generators were not truly random; I originally provided an excel file for my notes, thoughts, and procedures for testing, however I have found that github corrupts the file. I will be converting screenshots of the pages that I found pertinent and publishing those instead. Additionally this generator does not require preparation to work properly, ie. you do not call randomize() at any point. Finally it adds the ability to generate streams of random numeric digits of any length, output as a string. I will mirror this to my github at https://github.com/SamuelLanders/BetterRandNumGen as I believe that it is at least a superior random number generator to all the OS level random generators, and is FAR superior to the one that Godot uses. Anyone seeking to adopt it for use in any Javascript or other applications it should be very easy and fast to convert to such. 1.4 is updated with help and inputs from {Kindavacant,gruntmoon} which bring it up to date and compatible with Godot v4.4.1"
